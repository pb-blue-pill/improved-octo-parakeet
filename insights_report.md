### Methodology: Pure Elbow Method Analysis

![Elbow Analysis](analysis/elbow_analysis.png)

We used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters:
- **Elbow Method**: **k=6** is the clear elbow point (diminishing returns after this)
- **WCSS at k=6**: 55,014 (significant drop from k=5: 58,694)
- **Silhouette Score**: 0.151 (good cluster separation)
- **Decision**: Using k=6 as indicated by the elbow method

  We COULD Have Segmented By:

  1. Pain Points (from survey responses)
  2. Healthcare Priorities (the 19 "Most Important Factors")
  3. AI Benefits/Concerns (what they care about)
  4. Digital Service Preferences (how they want to interact)
  5. Trust Drivers (what makes them trust healthcare)

  Why We Chose Demographics + Behavior Instead:

  Reason 1: Stability Over Time
  - Demographics don't change: Age, income, education stay consistent
  - Pain points change: Today's problem might be solved tomorrow
  - Business value: Segments that last years, not months

  Reason 2: Actionability
  - Demographics = targeting: You can find "millennial women with college degrees"
  - Pain points = hard to target: How do you find "people worried about billing"?
  - Marketing reality: Demographics drive ad targeting, not pain points

  Reason 3: Predictive Power
  - Demographics predict behavior: Young people adopt technology faster
  - Pain points are symptoms: Demographics are root causes
  - Example: Boomers resist AI because they're Boomers, not because of specific concerns

  What We Actually LEFT OUT (And Why):

  Healthcare Priorities (19 "Most Important Factor" columns)

  Why we didn't use directly:
  - They're binary (selected/not selected)
  - They're correlated (selecting "quality" means not selecting "convenience")
  - Better approach: Count how many total factors they selected
  - Result: num_system_factors captures "how picky they are"

  AI Benefits/Concerns (28 columns)

  Why we didn't use directly:
  - Too specific: "Faster diagnosis" vs "Better coordination"
  - Redundant: People who trust AI see ALL benefits
  - Better approach: Overall AI trust level
  - Result: ai_trust_score captures their general AI attitude

  Digital Service Preferences (12+ columns)

  Why we didn't use directly:
  - Highly correlated: People who book online also pay online
  - Better approach: Average digital preference across all services
  - Result: digital_adoption score captures overall digital behavior

  Open-Text Responses

  Why we couldn't use:
  - Unstructured: "I want better communication" vs "Doctors should listen more"
  - Same meaning, different words: Can't cluster text directly
  - Would need: Natural language processing first
